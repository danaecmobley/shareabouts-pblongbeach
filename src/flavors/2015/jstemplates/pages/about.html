<p>Through Participatory Budgeting, community members - like you - directly decide how to spend at least $1,000,000 of the public budget in your Council District.</p>

<p>If you have an idea about how things could work better in your community, share it on the map. <a href="/page/guidelines" title="Participatory Budgeting in New York City | REAL MONEY. REAL PROJECTS. REAL POWER.">Check out the guidelines</a> to see what ideas can be funded.</p>

<p>Your idea will be then reviewed, alongside all the others, based on its feasibility, the need it would address, and the number of people it would benefit.</p>

<p>The top projects will be put on a ballot, and next April, all residents of each participating Council District will be able vote on which to fund.</p>
